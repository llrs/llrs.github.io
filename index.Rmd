## Introduction

You can find some projects both professional and pet projects in my [respositories.](https://github.com/llrs?tab=repositories)

# Pet projects

Projects I do on my own time, which eventually I hope will benefit me:

 - [Bioconductor stats:](https://llrs.github.com/BiocStats/) Analysing the relationship between downloads, IPs and the package in Bioconductor.
 - [WGCNA:](https://llrs.github.com/WGCNA/) Adding examples, tests and using roxygen in the WGCNA package.
 - [topGO:](https://github.com/llrs/topGO) Correcting some errors in the topGO package of Bioconductor.
 - [GOSemSim:](https://github.com/llrs/GOSemSim) Forked to improve some methods and add some others.
 
# Serious projects

Software projects I developed/contributed:

 - [BioCor:](https://bioconductor.org/packages/BioCor) An R package to calculate functional similarities thorough pathways. 
 - [BrokerMaster:](https://github.com/llrs/BrokerMaster) A website to link projects and investigators with master students
 - [IEO:](https:://llrs.github.com/IEO/IEO_report.html) Analysis of the thyroid carcinoma data from the TCGA project.
